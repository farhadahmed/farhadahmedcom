      <h2>About</h1>
      <p>
        Driven by a passion for software and web app development, I graduated from Code Fellows'â€‹ CS & Web Development Bootcamp as well as their Full-Stack JavaScript bootcamp.  I am currently TA-ing the same JS course.
      </p>

      <p>
        After graduating from the University of Washington, Seattle, my technical journey began at Flex-Plan Services where I undertook side projects with the company's software development team.  This was done outside of my normal work hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        These projects have involved minor fixes/updates to the core line-of-business application for the company.  These features are now used by an entire mid-sized company.
      </p>

      <p>
        I simultaneously began a C# certification program at Bellevue College.  Dissatisfied with the slow learning pace, I left my job to pursue my passion for programming.  It was then that I found Code Fellows where I completed every JavaScript course they offered and then became a Teacher's Assistant in their Full-Stack JavaScript bootcamp.
